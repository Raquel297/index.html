       <p>I purchased economy seats on the Kreme D'Airline's World-Plane Number 567. Little did I know that all seats in
          World-Plane Number 567 are luxury seats. Apparently, the airline deliberately created a plane (in fact, World-Plane Number 
          567 is the only the air-plane in Kreme D'Airlines that is a luxury plane) for the sole-purpose of flying important 
          ceo's and high level executives. However, Kreme D'Airlines is a public plane. They made it public for environmental reasons
          since solo-private planes are not good for the environment as they release more carbon-dioxide but take significantly less 
          passengers. High ranking ceo's and exceutives typically do not want to preuse public planes, therefore, Kreme D'Airlines 
          gets regular customers. They still decided to keep the World-PLane Number 567 a luxury-interior plane. So commoners such as
          myself can get cheaper priced airplane tickets (or as cheap as flying to Great Britain can be) with all the amentities of a
          private luxury plane. I purchased round-trip regular tickets (with no discounts) for $300 to and from. In total, I paid $600.
          To say the least, I strongly recommend you use this airline to travel internationally or inside your 
          country. The airline's service was absolutely outstanding. The flight-attendants were professional, friendly, and appeared
          every 20 minutes to refill the drink of your choice and give delicious assortments of luxury snacks.</p>

      <p>One of the best parts of being on a luxury flight is that there are no stops along the way. All flights on World-Plane 
         Number 567 have no stops and therefore, flights are shorter. I landed in London City Airport after 7 hours and 20 minutes.</p>
