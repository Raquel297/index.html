       <h2><b>I am a recent college graduate who has been working for a few years.
         <br>I decided to take a few years off before heading back to the workforce.</br>
         <br>My goal is to travel to 50 countries.</br>
         <br>I made this website so that I can share with you all my experiences from my travels.</br>
        <br>I hope to inspire you to get out of your comfort zone and experience the world!</br>
        <br>The only country I've visited so far was Great Britain, in particular London and The Country Side.</b></h2>
       <p>Disclaimer: All content, pictures, videos, places and experiences are fictional except for the country Britain and the city 
         in Britain named London. This website is for demonstratory purposes. 
         Although frankly, I do hope to travel the world someday.</p>
